## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to create a comprehensive study guide that would help students who are new to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to learn the basics and build their own websites. I wanted to create a resource that would make it easy for students to follow along and practice what they learned. I built this project because I believe that learning how to code and build websites is an essential skill in today's digital age. By providing a study guide, I hope to make it easier for students to get started with web development and help them to feel more confident in their abilities.
